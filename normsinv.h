/*
 * Lower tail quantile for standard normal distribution function.
 *
 * This function returns an approximation of the inverse cumulative
 * standard normal distribution function.  I.e., given P, it returns
 * an approximation to the X satisfying P = Pr{Z <= X} where Z is a
 * random variable from the standard normal distribution.
 *
 * The algorithm uses a minimax approximation by rational functions
 * and the result has a relative error whose absolute value is less
 * than 1.15e-9.
